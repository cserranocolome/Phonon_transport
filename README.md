# Phonon_transport
Codes used to simulate the phonon transport process in the ballistic and diffusive regimes.

The files in this respository are the following:

ballistic1d.py: code for the ballistic regime in a one-dimensional domain.

ballistic2d.py: code for the ballistic regime in a two-dimensional domain.

diffusive1d.py: code for the diffusive regime in a one-dimensional domain.

diffusive2d.py: code for the diffusive regime in a two-dimensional domain.
