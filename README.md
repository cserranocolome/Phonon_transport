# Phonon_transport
Codes used to simulate the phonon transport process in the ballistic and diffusive regimes.

The files in this repository are the following:

ballistic1d.py: code for the ballistic regime in a one-dimensional domain.

ballistic2d.py: code for the ballistic regime in a two-dimensional domain.

diffusive1d.py: code for the diffusive regime in a one-dimensional domain.

diffusive2d.py: code for the diffusive regime in a two-dimensional domain.

mean_free_path.py: code to compute the mean free path of the phonons.

tableNT.py: code to create the table N-T, with the number of phonons and the corresponding temperature according to the initial conditions.

statistics.py: code to compute statistical treatment of the data obtained in the simulations.
